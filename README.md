## 🛠️ Technical Features

* **Custom Titleless Window**: Implemented using `overrideredirect(True)` for a clean, widget-like appearance.
* **Interactive Draggability**: Custom mouse-binding logic allows the user to reposition the window despite the lack of a standard title bar.
* **Dynamic UI Elements**: Features real-time updates for time (HH:MM:SS), full date, and day of the week.
* **Contextual Logic**: Includes a dynamic greeting system that adjusts based on the system's 24-hour cycle.
* **Layered Interface**: Utilizes a dark-themed hex palette (`#1a1a1a`) with high-contrast text for maximum readability.
